# ST-AMCNN:	Pose-Guided Matching for Assessing Quality of Action on Rehabilitation Training

By Yuhang Qiu, Jiping Wang, Zhe Jin, Mingliang Zhang and Liquan Guo at Chinese Academy of Sciences and Monash university.

### Introduction

**ST-AMCNN** is a patch-based Siamese Convolutional Neural Network employed for pose-guided matching on the eight-section brocade dataset which is one of the most representative traditional rehabiblitation exercises in China.  

Here is a the test model for demonstration. This code is implemented by Python. When the paper is received, the complete code will be made public

### Requirements: software

0. `Python 3.7`: cv2, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, PIL, sklearn
0. `Pytorch 1.5.1`

### Predicting Demo
0.  For similar pose images matching : Run `python ST-AMCNN.py 1 2` or `python ST-AMCNN.py 3 4` to test demo images provided in `images/`.
    - You will see the visualized comparsion results, The redder areas indicated this part of poses is highly matched and obtains high score between the learnerâ€™s pose and         standard pose.
0.  For different pose images matching : Run `python ST-AMCNN.py 1 3` or `python ST-AMCNN.py 2 4` to test demo images provided in `images/`.
    - You will see there are few comparative results because the input poses are totally different. The model cannot give the suggestion for rectification.
