By Yuhang Qiu, Jiping Wang, Zhe Jin, Mingliang Zhang and Liquan Guo at Chinese Academy of Sciences and Monash university.

### Introduction

**ST-AMCNN** is a patch-based Siamese Convolutional Neural Network employed for pose-guided matching on the eight-section brocade dataset which is one of the most representative traditional rehabiblitation exercises in China.  

Here is a the test model for demonstration. This code is implemented by Python. When the paper is received, the complete code will be made public

### Requirements: software

0. `Python 3.7`: cv2, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, PIL, sklearn
0. `Pytorch 1.5.1`
